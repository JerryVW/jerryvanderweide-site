                <h2>Hello, I'm Jerry Vander Weide and I am a fullstack developer.</h2>
                <p>I have always had a creative side since I was little. I would build things with LEGOS and draw pictures all the time.
                    But things changed and I drifted away from all that.
                </p>
                <p>Up until a few years ago, that is.....</p>
                <p>I then went back to school and discovered web development. I instatnly fell in love with the creativity it allowed me to
                    have and that I can create anything if I put my mind to it.
                </p>
                <p>So now I have my new style of LEGOS and drawing paper and have been building and creating websites ever since. It is
                    a career that I can truely enjoy.

                    <span>TODO List App</span>
                    <img class="example-pic" src="img/ToDo_List_Screenshot.png" alt="Profile Picture">
                    <p>Building this ToDo project helped me further my knowledge of Javascript. Getting things to appear, disappear and crossing off the items was a good challenge for me to figure out and to get to work properly.
                    </p>

                    <p>I also learned a new CSS layout model that I have not used before called Flexbox. It made working with the layout very easy to do with the few elements that I worked with. Along with that, I learned about local storage and how to add and remove items form it.

                    <span>Rock, Paper, Scissors Game</span>
                    <img class="example-pic" src="img/RPS_Screenshot.png" alt="Profile Picture">
                    <p>Building this rock, paper, scissors game brought about some new challenges with manipulating classes to change images and my first time using the switch statement. I also got a taste of trying to get scores to increment and learned a valuable lesson on parameters and arguments when it comes to functions.
                    </p>

                    <p>I got more practice on manipulating the DOM. Once I got all the functionality working properly I just kept wanting to add new features and learning more ways to do things differently.

                    <img class="example-pic" src="img/expense-tracker.png" alt="Profile Picture">
                    <p>Making this expense tracker was a lot of fun. It was a good challenge to get all the elements to display out in a table format. Knowing how to do this will help me when working with data from a backend server.
                    </p>

                    <p>I also used local storage on this project. That proved to be a bigger challenge than what I thought. But it was a great learning experience.

                    <img class="example-pic" src="img/Guitar-site.png" alt="Profile Picture">
                    <p>This website is something I came up with as a beginner project. I used the bootstrap framework for my HTML, which made the layout easya nd fully responsive. 
                    </p>

                    <p>The Javascript was fun to create for this project. I had no experience getting lists to hide and appear when an attribute was selected, nor setting up a form to be emailed. I really enjoyed making this website.
