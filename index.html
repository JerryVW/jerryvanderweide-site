                <h2>Hello, I'm Jerry Vander Weide and I am a fullstack developer.</h2>
                <p>I have always had a creative side since I was little. I would build things with LEGOS and draw pictures all the time.
                    But things changed and I drifted away from all that.
                </p>
                <p>Up until a few years ago, that is.....</p>
                <p>I then went back to school and discovered web development. I instantly fell in love with the creativity it allowed me to
                    have and that I can create anything if I put my mind to it.
                </p>
                <p>So now I have my new style of LEGOS and drawing paper and have been building and creating websites ever since. It is
                    a career that I can truely enjoy.
                </p>

            <h2 class="projects-title">Here are a few things I have created</h2>
            <div class="projects1">

                <div class="single-project">
                    <span>Rock, Paper, Scissors Game</span>
                    <a href="https://jerryvw.github.io/rps-game/" target="_blank"><img class="example-pic" src="img/RPS_Screenshot.png" alt="Profile Picture"></a>
                    <p>Building this rock, paper, scissors game brought about some new challenges with manipulating classes to change images and my first time using the switch statement. I also got a taste of trying to get scores to increment and learned a valuable lesson on parameters and arguments when it comes to functions.
                    </p>

                    <p>It was fun trying to get the logic to work correctly, then breaking it down to simplify the code and still manage to get it to work.</p>

                    <p>I got more practice on manipulating the DOM. I really enjoy creating things out of nowhere and having them be a functioning part of the page.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Once I got all the functionality working properly I just kept wanting to add new features and learning more ways to do things differently.
                    </p>

                <div class="single-project">
                    <span>Expense Tracker App</span>
                    <a href="https://jerryvw.github.io/expense-tracker/" target="_blank"><img class="example-pic" src="img/expense-tracker.png" alt="Profile Picture"></a>
                    <p>Making this expense tracker was a lot of fun. It was a good challenge to get all the elements to display out in a table format. Also, knowing how to manipulate data like this will help me when working with data from a backend server.
                    I liked creating each function that made a table element and then getting it all to line up in their own cells.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>I used Felxbox on this to make it easy to get all of my HTML inputs to line up nicely for clean layout. I used a little more CSS on this project than on others, as I wanted to give it a nice look and feel for the user. </p>

                    <p>I also used local storage on this project. That proved to be a bigger challenge than what I thought. It was a little different than how I used it on the ToDo app because it was more elements than just one. But it was a great learning experience, nonetheless.

                <div class="single-project">
                    <span>Calculator App</span>
                    <a href="https://jerryvw.github.io/calculator/" target="_blank"><img class="example-pic" src="img/Calculator-App.png" alt="Profile Picture"></a>
                    <p>Building this calculator project helped me further my knowledge of Javascript. Getting all the calculations to work properly was a great challenge for me to figure out. Fixing one problem and having another one pop up gave me a real sense of how programming is.
                    </p>

                    <p>I got a lot of experience using the debugging tools in Chrome. Having to run the code over and over, putting stops at different points in the code, and breaking down what was going wrong helped me develope my problem solving skills to a new level.
                    </p>
 
                     <p>Along with that, I learned about bubbling. This made cycling through all my buttons very easy. I used switch statements for the calculations and memory buttons to siimplify the functionality. This has been one of my favorite projects to work on, so far.

                <div class="single-project">
                    <span>Guitar Selection Website</span>
                    <a href="" target="_blank"><img class="example-pic" src="img/Guitar-site.png" alt="Profile Picture"></a>
                    <p>This website is something I came up with as a beginner project. I used the bootstrap framework for my HTML, which made the layout easy and fully responsive. I enjoyed making it one large page with multiple sections. Still giving it a feel of having different pages.
                    </p>

                    <p>With this site I tried to work on my design skills a little more and pick colors and fonts the clean. I really love to make website that are visually appealing, as well as functional. I have also created mt first logo desing for this site, too.</p>

                    <p>The Javascript was fun to create for this project. I had no experience switching between lists and getting them to hide and appear when an attribute was selected, nor setting up a form to be emailed. I really enjoyed making this website.
